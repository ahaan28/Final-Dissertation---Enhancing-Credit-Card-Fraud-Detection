This comprehensive analysis presents an end-to-end fraud detection system leveraging machine learning and deep learning techniques to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The project begins with meticulous data preprocessing, including handling missing values through iterative imputation for numerical features and mode imputation for categorical variables, capping outliers in transaction amounts, and strategic feature engineering. The "Amount" feature is weighted to amplify its importance, while SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique) addresses severe class imbalanceâ€”only 7.2% of transactions are fraudulent. The processed data undergoes rigorous modeling with traditional ML algorithms (Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost) and deep learning architectures (CNNs, LSTMs, GRUs), all optimized via hyperparameter tuning.
